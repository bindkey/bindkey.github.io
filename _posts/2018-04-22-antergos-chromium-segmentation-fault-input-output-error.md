title: "Antergos chromium segmentation fault input output error "
---

After an update from Antergos, chromium browser
had an infamous `segmentation fault` with its
`core dumped` enclosed between parentheses. 

Clicking through its gui interface, would simply
return an input/output error.

I didn't have enough time to look up the issue, And
whatever I found about the issue, was not relevant
to the problem. 

I did notice though, that chromium-flags was the
culprit.
