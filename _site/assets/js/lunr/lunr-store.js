        "excerpt":"It is my opinion, based mostly not on what I’ve read, but instead on what I’ve encountered during the handling of a failed hard disk, that the disk volume mounting utility udisks2 fares better than say, ntfs-3g.Quite possibly there could be many improvements with this software, and there is no doubt about it, but considering wear-and-tear conditions of the disk, among other considerations, and, as long as udisks2 is run without an interruption, no other mounting options utility that is currently available may be able to improve its overall performance.If time is not a constraint, and the program is allowed to run on its own, udisks2 fairs relatively better on previously loaded Windows OS partitions than any other. Of this I can attest without a doubt. The utility has been able to eventually access corrupted filesystems that would have been rendered unrecoverable otherwiseFor futher info and configuration, visit the wiki:Mount to /media (udisks2)Udisksntfs-3g Arch Linuxudiskie on github","categories": [],

        "title": "Antergos Grub Selection",
        "excerpt":"During the installation of Antergos, there was an option to install the Linux LTS kernel along with the default latest stable version.Even though it was installed appropriately, the option to select the other kernel, could not be seen from the Grub selection window.this is even after running the usual mkinitcpio -p  that loads the modules and other dependencies accordingly.It’s good to remember that Grub configuration file though, resides on the /boot/default directory.With sudo privileges, access the file at /boot/default/grub first.Therein, and lying at the bottom of the configuration file, one can find the:  # Uncomment to make GRUB remember the last selection. This requires to  # set 'GRUB_DEFAULT=saved' above.  #GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=\"true\"One could uncomment the GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=”true” so the grub configuration file ‘remembers’ the selection.Furthermore, and right on the top of the file the default chosen selection can be specified by modifying the value of 0:  # GRUB boot loader configuration  GRUB_DEFAULT=0To a 2 or 3 for the desired kernel. Which in my case, and if the LTS kernel is to be loaded instead, matched the kernel itself and the fallback for it.By going this route, it no longer is necessary in specifying during the system startup, the desired kernel that one chooses to be loaded.Remember after making any changes to grub, to update the configuration file by running: grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfgFor more info about this, visit the wiki:GRUB/Tips and tricks","categories": [],

        "title": "Antergos Keyboard Selection During Installation",
        "excerpt":"One of the drawbacks during the installation of Antergos Linux was in identifying the keyboard layout option that was previously selected during the media installation.As a result only the default variant was being used after installing the system.I was able to identify the problem by going to the X window system xorg configuration file /etc/X11/xorg.d/00-keyboard.conf and noticing that the XkbLayout variant was not being properly identified as originally intended.In my case, only one of the options had been specified correctly on the 00-keyboard.conf file.What I found odd, is that on another system, which is by the way, running the same xfce environment from Antergos, the same problem was not encountered. On the other system, only one (1) variant was used, and it had correctly identified the layout twice, but on the system which after installing the Antergos media, loaded the incorrect values, two (2) variants were set accordingly, but only one (1) layout option was identified. In my case us had been been identified once, whereas with the former no issues pertaining to this problem occurred in the first place.As the wiki Using X configuration files wiki recommends, not to modify any of the settings manually, but let instead localectl handle it. 1Of course, it comes handy when there is even an example that illustrates the process by using the correct parameters. For something like:Then something like the following 2, based on the previous example, suffices:Set the values as deemed applicable to the desired customization.ReferencesUsing X Configuration files 00-keyboard.conf &#x21A9;&#xFE0E;Using localectl &#x21A9;&#xFE0E;","categories": [],
